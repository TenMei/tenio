# TenIO

TenIO is a java NIO (Non-blocking I/O) based server specifically designed for multiplayer games. It supports UDP and TCP transports which are handled by [Netty](https://netty.io/) or [Apache Mina](https://mina.apache.org/) for high-speed network transmission. It uses [MsgPack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) for compressing data so that can be transferred quickly through the network. This framework can help you quickly create a game server or integrate it into your system.

## Features
- Easy-to-use, OOP design.
- Based on standard Java development, ensuring cross-platform support.
- Simple event handlers implementation.
- Simple physic simulator and debugger.
- Have simple existing C++ and Java game clients for rapid development.
